This is a simple Python implementation of the Pseudospectra Algorithms introduced in 
``Pseudospectra of rectangular matrices'' by T. Wright and L.N. Trefethen. 

The main algorithms are implemented in the flie rectpsa.py and three examples of how to use them are given in the three
example?.py scripts. Furthermore, the classical example of the linear model used in the first page of the book: "Spectra and Pseudospectra: The Behavior of Nonnormal Matrices and Operators" is implemented along with the plot function. 

## Requirements
-  Python 3
-  Numpy 
-  Scipy
-  Matplotlib (in case the user would like to run some of the examples)

The scripts have been tested on the following platform: 
```
Platform: linux
Python: 3.6.8
[GCC 8.3.0]
Machine and architecture x86_64 ('64bit', 'ELF')
NumPy: 1.17.3
SciPy: 1.3.1
matplotlib: 3.1.1
```
